This is the second Chapter in my journey with Pentest+ Today we will be looking at Planning and Scopping Penetration Tests

## Table of Contents

## Scoping and Planning Engagements

Before we begin a penetration test we must first determine the scope of what we will be doing while conducting the penetration test. We must work with those who are a part of the organization which we will be testing to determine what is and what is not allowed. Why the test is being performed and specific compliance and business needs. 

<h4>Assessment Types</h4>

1. *Goals-based or objectives-based assessments*
2. *Compliance-based Assessments*
3. *Red-Team assessments*

<h4>Known and Unknown environments</h4>

Known environments, which are also known as White-Box tests, test the site as a whole with full knowledge of all the network interfaces, services, ports and underlying technology, and configurations. A known environment test can be more complete than a Black-box test or grey-box test because they use everything. Black-Box tests provide no knowledge and it is often used to simulate an actual attack. But this also depends on the skill level of the black-box tester. Grey Box tests or Partial knowledge can help the penetration tester focus on what actually needs to be done in a less amount of time to simulate an actual attack. 

<h4>Rules of Engagement</h4>

1. *Timeline* Start and stop time of the tests. What hours of the day you can test and which days you can test as not to meddle with productivity of the business.
2. *Systems, Locations and applications* are in scope this includes physical/nonphysical DNS/Domains IP ranges etc.
3. *Types of tests allowed* Specifically a company might not want to test the susceptibality of phishing attacks, they might not want to let you use specfic tools that might disrupt workflow. Or maybe things that might be distructive.
