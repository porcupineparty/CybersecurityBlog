YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym) is a tool used to identify and classify malware by defining rules based on textual or binary patterns. These rules consist of a set of strings, conditions, and optional metadata. If a file matches the conditions specified in a rule, YARA flags the file and alerts the user. YARA rules can not only identify a file as malware, but also reveal specific properties of the malware, attribute it to particular threat actors, and determine the malware family or type.

    rule example_rule{
	strings:
		$example_string = "This is an example string."

	condition:
		$example_string
}

```
